**Overview**
This repository contains a Python-based project for performing **Sentiment Analysis on Flipkart Reviews** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis helps us understand the sentiments of customers towards products and services by analyzing their reviews. In this project, we will extract and analyze customer reviews from Flipkart and determine whether they are Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

**Project Structure**
The project structure is organized as follows:


├── data/
│   ├── flipkart_reviews.csv        # Raw Flipkart reviews dataset
│   ├── cleaned_reviews.csv         # Cleaned dataset after preprocessing
│
├── notebooks/
│   ├── Flipkart_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb   # Jupyter notebook for analysis
│
├── requirements.txt                # List of required Python packages
├── README.md                       # Project README file
├── LICENSE                         # Project license file

**Requirements**
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

numpy
pandas
nltk
scikit-learn
textblob
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these packages using the command mentioned in the "Getting Started" section.

**Data Collection**
We need a dataset of customer reviews to perform sentiment analysis on Flipkart reviews. You can collect this data by scraping Flipkart using web scraping tools or APIs. Once you have collected the data, save it as a CSV file in the data/ directory.

**Data Preprocessing**
Before performing sentiment analysis, cleaning and preprocessing the text data is essential. Data preprocessing includes tasks such as text cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, and more. You can use the data_preprocessing.py script provided in the src/ directory to preprocess the data.

**Sentiment Analysis**
Sentiment analysis is performed using NLP techniques and machine learning models. The sentiment_analysis.py script in the src/ directory contains code for sentiment analysis. You can modify and fine-tune the models as needed to improve accuracy.

**Results**
After performing sentiment analysis, you can visualize the results and gain insights into customer sentiment. The Jupyter notebook Flipkart_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb in the notebooks/ directory provides a detailed analysis of the results.
